<p>
  Hello! I'm Ryan Kwon. I'm the creator, maintainer, and sole content contributor to 
  <%= NAME_OF_SITE %>.
  I've been part of two (technically three) startups: the first as an intern
  software developer coding with Python/Kivy, the second as a CTO and co-founder.
</p>

<p>
  I created aRg after leaving the second startup. This was motivated in part 
  to provide a platform for blogging as well as a publishing medium for several
  of my projects, but was largely instantiated in order to give me free rein 
  to experiment with a variety of languages and technologies.
</p>

<p>
  If you're interested in the source code, the github repo is  
  <%= link_to "here", 'https://github.com/rynkwn/rblog' %>.
  The markdown document also records my early thoughts while creating the site in
  sequential order, and covers things from design decisions to thoughts on structure.
  Admittedly however, it's become somewhat out of date and I've made changes to some of my
  initial decisions.
</p>

<p>
  If you want to contact me for whatever reason (I am a fan of other people doing
  startups. I also enjoy answering questions and writing emails, on top of just
  hearing about cool things related to space development, energy research, 
  AI, or technology in general): rynkwn@gmail.com
