<h1>Daily Messenger</h1>
<h4 class='center'>(AKA Project Gefilte Fish)</h4>

<br>
<br>

<p>
  Daily Messages are great, but there's a metric ton of them. It's easy to lose
  track of things you're genuinely interested in, and way too easy to miss out
  on opportunities you wish you had taken.
</p>

<p>
  With the Daily Messenger, you can specify what topics you're interested in, 
  as well as what departments, clubs, or people you're always happy
  to hear from. Once you set your preferences, we'll do the filtering, 
  and everyday we'll send you a special email
  containing only the Daily Message content you want.

<h2>FAQ</h2>

<p class='bold'>
  Q: How exactly does this process work?
</p>

<p>
  Once you sign up for an account, go to "My Daily Messenger." Then, check off
  the boxes you're interested in.
</p>

<p>
  Once you click "Submit," you're done! I'll automatically send you a filtered
  version of Daily Messages every day. If there's nothing that'll interest you,
  I'll send you an email with the subject line: "Nothing interesting today!"
</p>

<br>

<p class='bold'>
  Q: So it's just a filtered version of Daily Messages?
</p>

<p>
  We also include a couple ease-of-living features like a button that adds
  the event to your Google Calendar with the appropriate time, date, and name.
</p>
  
<p>
  In case you like the Daily Messages a lot the way it is, we also include an
  <b>anti-filter</b>! This anti-filter takes your selection of groups and topics
  and returns the normal Daily Messages with those things taken OUT!
</p>

<p>
  I'm always interested in making the service better, however. So if there's
  something you'd like to see, let me know! Either by emailing me at rynkwn@gmail.com
  or anonymously at

</p>

<br>

<p class='bold'>
  Q: I set my preferences, but I didn't get my Daily Messenger!
</p>

<p>
  Wait a day! Unless you sign-up super-early in the morning,
  it's unlikely that you'll get an email the same day.
</p>

<br>

<p class='bold'>
  Q: The stuff I'm interested in isn't a topic/group :(
</p>

<p>
  Email me what you're interested in! (rynkwn@gmail.com or rhk1@williams.edu)
  Once you do, I'll delve back into the murky depths of dozens of Daily Messages
  to parse out what's necessary to have your stuff be an option. Remember,
  a lot of people could benefit from you telling me what you'd like to see.
  If you want to be anonymous, simply go here!

<p class='bold'>
  Q: ... Why does it say it's also known as "Project Gefilte Fish"?
</p>

<p>
  Er. Well. When I was trying to come up with a name for the service, I kept
  trying variations of "Filter." Eventually, I was reminded of a blooper from
  Rush Hour 2, and I ended up thinking "Wow. Gefilte Fish is a GREAT name for a
  service." I eventually chose "Daily Messenger," but I still like "Gefilte Fish."
</p>

<br>

<p class='bold'>
  Q: What happens to the original Daily Messages?
</p>

<p>
  Absolutely nothing. I can't overtly stop the college from sending those emails,
  so you'll receive both the Daily Messenger's content-tailed emails as well as
  the original daily messages. You know, just in case you want to see everything.
</p>

<br>

<p class='bold'>
  Q: So I'll get an extra email on top of Daily Messages?
</p>

<p>
  Yep! Every weekday there's a daily message, the Daily Messenger will send you
  an extra email filtered for just the things you're interested in. If you ever
  want these emails to stop, just look at the tabs above and click Account >
  Delete my Account.
</p>

<br>

<p class='bold'>
  Q: How much is this going to cost me?
</p>

<p>
  Nothing. Like all great college products, it's so free it actually is free.
  I'll always appreciate donations, 
  but for normal users this service will remain free indefinitely. Or at 
  least until my server explodes. Whichever comes first.
</p>

<br>

<p class='bold'>
  Q: What do you mean by "normal users?"
</p>

<p>
  In the far and grim-dark future, I may allow some people to do promotions through the Daily
  Messenger, but I'll make every possible effort to be sure it's ONLY promotions
  you might be interested in. For example: MASS MoCA surveying Williams students
  about new exhibits and you list a passion for the contemporary arts, 
  developer meetups taking place in North Adams when
  you say you're interested about professional coders in the area,
  or Psychology students offering free cake to
  perform an experiment and, you being a human being, say you're interested in cake.
</p>

<p>
  My goal is to make this service maximally useful to Williams students, and in
  our seven months of operation (as of October 1st, 2016), there has never been
  a single ad or fluff email sent out to a user.
</p>

<br>

<p class='bold'>
  Q: Why do you keep saying "I?" Don't you mean "We?"
</p>

<p>
  I don't remember hiring you ._.
</p>

<br>

<p class='bold'>
  Q: Did anyone actually ask these questions?
</p>

<p>
  I spend a lot of time alone.
