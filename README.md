The code repo for the blogging platform -INSERT URL HERE-

# Why do you have a RoR code repo?
So while I am interested in blogging some of my experiences in startups and 
side projects, it seemed like a good opportunity to also play A LOT with Rails,
HTML, CSS, some dialect of J-Script, and a variety of other things which I've
tampered with, but haven't quite had the freedom to explore.

# Step One - Fail with Devise
Had an in: :range error inside ActiveModel, so, off-handedly, I suppose there's
a conflict between the version of devise I was using and Rails 4.2.1 (which
appears quite new at the time of this writing.)

In the end, in the interest of time and not digging into the given Rails classes,
went with building my own OAuth system. Should be a more interesting exercise that
way.

# Step Two - CSS
